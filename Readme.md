# Visualizing Earthquake Data with Leaflet

In this project, visualizations have been created using earthquakes data that occur globally using a live API feed provided by the USGS (United States Geological Survey). The data in the feed is updated every 5 mins, and includes all earthquake data for the past month. Additional layer of tectonic plates has been created to understand the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activites.
